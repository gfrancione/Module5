Notes and help for Pymaceuticals

For statistics portion I used a tutor anc ChtGPT.
# Ask tutor why (mm3)/need to understand
#Note help in Readme file that ChtGPT helped fix warning is related to the use of numeric_only in Pandas 

I also looked for help with numeric_only warning. 
#Ask BCS or Tutor about number_only, I dont see where it is pulling something that is not numeric.

Correlation and Regression.
I primarily had help from tutor to help string formula's together, although I could look htem up, I was completely lost at putting them together. 
#Note for Readme. This help came from tutor, but it has been so long since I got back to it, look in email for date
